# Mind&Skin Dreem Analysis

## Overview

### Analysis Goals

#### 1. **Power Spectral Density (PSD) Comparison Across Groups**

-   **By sleep stage**: For each stage (W, N1, N2, N3, R), compare the PSD.

-   **By group**: Plot PSD for the 3 participant groups (e.g., control, mild, severe).

-   **Channels**: Use **F7 and F8** (especially: EEG_F8_O2, EEG_F7_O2).

-   **Plot type**: Frequency (Hz) on x-axis, Power on y-axis. One line per group.

#### 2. **Statistical Comparison**

-   Extract total power in specific bands (e.g., delta: 0.5–4 Hz).

-   Run statistical comparisons (1-way ANOVA) across the 3 groups.

-   Use per-subject averaged values from sigstats or PSD.

#### 3. **Variability Over Multiple Nights**

-   For participants with \>1 night:

    -   Measure **intra-subject PSD variability**

    -   Assess device consistency

### Power Spectral Density (PSD) Analysis by Sleep Stage and Group

#### What is PSD?

Power Spectral Density (PSD) is a method used to quantify the distribution of power across different frequency bands in EEG signals. It transforms time-domain data (e.g., EEG voltage over time) into frequency-domain representations, allowing us to evaluate how much power (i.e., signal strength) exists in specific frequency ranges, such as delta (0.5–4 Hz), theta (4–8 Hz), alpha (8–12 Hz), and others.

In the context of sleep EEG, different frequency bands are known to correlate with different physiological and cognitive states. For example:

-   **Delta power (0.5–4 Hz)** is prominent in deep (N3) sleep.

-   **Alpha power** is typically reduced in sleep but can be a marker of wakefulness or arousal.

-   **Spindle and beta activity** may relate to sleep architecture stability or disturbance.

#### Why PSD is Useful for This Study

In this pediatric eczema study, comparing PSD across severity groups allows us to:

-   **Quantify sleep differences** objectively beyond clinical scores or subjective reports.

-   **Detect neurophysiological signatures** of inflammation, itching, or sleep fragmentation.

-   **Compare signal characteristics** across groups in each sleep stage to see if certain EEG dynamics are altered in more severe eczema.

This analysis is especially relevant given the Dreem device’s multi-night home-based acquisition — allowing assessment of **naturalistic, ecologically valid sleep data** across groups.

#### Goals of This Step

1.  **Compare PSD across sleep stages and groups**

    -   For each sleep stage (W, N1, N2, N3, R), we will generate PSD curves.

    -   Each curve will show average PSD (power vs. frequency) for each group.

    -   One plot per stage, with 3 lines (Group 1–3).

    -   Frequency (Hz) on x-axis, power (uV²/Hz) on y-axis.

2.  **Use clean and consistent EEG signals**

    -   Only channels involving F7 and F8 (frontal) will be analyzed.

    -   These channels were chosen due to lower noise in Dreem recordings, per prior QC and Luna guidance.

    -   Specific channels include: `EEG_F7_O1,EEG_F8_O2,EEG_F8_F7,EEG_F8_O1,EEG_F7_O2`

3.  **Extract summary statistics from PSD**

    -   Using Luna’s `SIGSTATS` command, we can compute total power within specific frequency bands.

    -   For example, we will extract **delta power** (0.5–4 Hz) and compare across groups.

    -   This becomes input for statistical tests such as **one-way ANOVA**.

4.  **Assess night-to-night variability**

    -   For participants with multiple nights, we will compare PSD estimates across those nights.

    -   This gives insight into:

        -   **Intra-subject variability**

        -   **Signal stability across nights**

        -   **Device consistency**

#### Why Stratifying by Sleep Stage Matters

Each sleep stage has unique EEG spectral characteristics:

-   **Wake (W)**: Higher alpha/beta

-   **N1**: Mixed low-frequency patterns

-   **N2**: Spindles, theta

-   **N3**: Dominated by delta power

-   **REM (R)**: Lower amplitude, mixed frequencies

Analyzing PSD without stratifying by stage would collapse meaningful variation — so Luna’s ability to compute stage-specific PSD (`PSD STAGE`) is crucial.

#### Tools Used

We use Luna’s:

-   `PSD` command to estimate spectral power

-   `SIGSTATS` to extract band-specific power summaries

-   `CHEP` to apply signal quality masks (prior step)

-   `destrat` to extract outputs for R

-   R to merge PSD data with `id_group_map.csv` for visualization and statistical testing

## Analysis

### Plot 1: Relative Band Power by Group (EEG_F8_F7)

#### **Purpose & Rationale**

This plot explores **relative spectral power** across canonical frequency bands—**delta (0.5–4 Hz), theta (4–8 Hz), alpha (8–12 Hz), and beta (12–30 Hz)**—to investigate potential neurophysiological differences between children with **atopic eczema (AE)** and **healthy controls**. The focus is specifically on the **EEG_F8_F7 channel**, selected due to its superior signal quality in this Dreem-derived dataset.

Relative power is computed as the **proportion of total power** within a specific frequency band, allowing comparisons across subjects with varying absolute signal strength. This standardization is essential given the heterogeneous signal amplitudes from home EEG setups.

This analysis addresses the hypothesis that **children with more severe AE may exhibit altered sleep-related EEG dynamics**, potentially reflecting neurodevelopmental or inflammatory effects.

#### **Methods Summary**

For this analysis, we focused on the **EEG_F8_F7** channel, selected based on prior signal quality inspection. Power spectral density (PSD) data were filtered to include only the **delta, theta, alpha, and beta** frequency bands, corresponding to commonly studied core sleep-related rhythms. The dataset was limited to these bands using a conditional filter (`B %in% c("DELTA", "THETA", "ALPHA", "BETA")`). Participants were stratified into three groups—**healthy controls**, **mild atopic eczema (AE)**, and **severe AE**—based on clinical metadata. The primary variable analyzed was **relative power spectral density (RELPSD)**, representing each band’s contribution as a fraction of total PSD. Data were visualized using grouped boxplots overlaid with jittered individual data points (semi-transparent for outliers), with colors assigned by group for visual clarity.

```{r}
core_bands <- c("DELTA", "THETA", "ALPHA", "BETA")

rel_df <- dreem_initial$PSD$B_CH %>%
  rename(standard_id = ID) %>%
  filter(B %in% core_bands) %>%
  left_join(metadata, by = "standard_id")

ggplot(rel_df, aes(x = B, y = RELPSD, fill = group)) +
  geom_boxplot(width = 0.6, position = position_dodge(width = 0.7), outlier.alpha = 0.3) +
  labs(
    title = "Relative Band Power by Group (EEG_F8_F7)",
    subtitle = "Comparing delta, theta, alpha, and beta bands across AE severity and controls",
    x = "Frequency Band", y = "Relative PSD (fraction of total)", fill = "Group"
  ) +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c(
    "healthy controls" = "slateblue",
    "mild AE" = "plum3",
    "severe AE" = "hotpink3"
  )) +
  theme_bw(base_size = 14) +
  theme(
    plot.title = element_text(face = "bold"),
    plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 11),
    legend.position = "top",
    legend.title = element_text(face = "bold"),
    axis.title = element_text(face = "bold")
  )

```

#### **3. Interpretation of Results & Preliminary Conclusion**

Across all groups, the **delta band** consistently exhibits the highest relative power, as expected during sleep. Visually, **healthy controls** appear to have slightly **higher delta power** compared to both AE groups, while **mild and severe AE groups** show slightly **elevated theta and beta power**. The **alpha band** remains low across all groups with minimal variation.

These patterns suggest that children with atopic eczema may exhibit **subtle alterations in sleep-related brain activity**, particularly with **reduced delta** and **slightly elevated faster frequency bands** (theta/beta). While exploratory, these differences could reflect underlying differences in **sleep quality or neurodevelopment** associated with AE severity.

### **Plot 2: MS36 - Night-to-Night PSD Variability (EEG_F8_F7)**

#### **Purpose & Rationale**

Understanding **intra-individual variability** in EEG power spectral density (PSD) is critical when interpreting sleep metrics, particularly in pediatric populations with conditions like atopic eczema (AE), where night-to-night variability may reflect fluctuations in disease severity, itch, or sleep quality. This plot explores **the temporal stability of spectral profiles** for a single subject (MS36) over 10 nights, providing insight into **trait vs. state EEG features** and guiding decisions around the **number of nights needed for reliable estimates**.

#### **Methods Summary**

PSD values were extracted from the `CH_F` output of Luna, representing power across frequency bins for each EEG channel. Data were filtered to include only channel **EEG_F8_F7** and subject **MS36**, across all available nights. The PSD curves (0–25 Hz range) were plotted per night using `ggplot2::facet_wrap()`, with consistent axis scaling to enable visual comparison. Each line represents the absolute PSD (µV²/Hz) per frequency bin for that night.

```{r}
ms36_df <- dreem_initial$PSD$CH_F %>%
  rename(standard_id = ID) %>%
  left_join(metadata, by = "standard_id") %>%
  filter(subject_id == "MS36", CH == "EEG_F8_F7")

ggplot(ms36_df, aes(x = F, y = PSD)) +
  geom_line(color = "deeppink3", size = 0.8, alpha = 0.8) +
  facet_wrap(~ night, ncol = 5, labeller = label_both) +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(0, 25, 5)) +
  scale_y_continuous(expand = expansion(mult = c(0, 0.05))) +
  labs(
    title = "MS36: Night-to-Night PSD Variability (EEG_F8_F7)",
    subtitle = "Power spectral density across 10 nights (0–25 Hz)",
    x = "Frequency (Hz)", y = expression(PSD~(mu*V^2/Hz))
  ) +
  theme_minimal(base_size = 13) +
  theme(
    plot.title = element_text(face = "bold", size = 16),
    plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 12),
    strip.text = element_text(face = "bold"),
    panel.grid.minor = element_blank()
  )

```

![](images/clipboard-2192813418.png)

#### **Interpretation of Results & Preliminary Conclusion**

The plotted curves show a **consistent spectral shape across nights**, with a pronounced **delta band peak (\<4 Hz)** reflecting expected high-amplitude slow-wave activity during sleep. Some nights (e.g., **N1 and N4**) exhibit **elevated delta power**, suggesting possible variation in sleep depth, artifact presence, or physiological factors such as itch or movement.

Overall, **the PSD profile is relatively stable**, indicating that this subject's spectral features are reproducible across nights. However, the **modest variability in magnitude** supports the use of **multi-night averaging** in pediatric sleep-neurophysiology research, particularly when quantifying EEG biomarkers sensitive to state-level fluctuations.

### **Plot 3: MS32 - Relative Delta Power by Visit (EEG_F8_F7)**

#### **Purpose & Rationale**

This plot evaluates whether **relative delta power**, a marker of deep (slow-wave) sleep, **changes from Visit 1 (V1) to Visit 2 (V2)** in subject **MS32**, a child with severe atopic eczema placed on systemic treatment. Delta activity is a well-established indicator of sleep depth and quality, and longitudinal changes in this band may reflect **clinical response to treatment**, **reduction in night-time itch**, or other physiological shifts. Understanding intra-subject changes is essential for assessing the **sensitivity of EEG markers to interventions**.

#### **Methods Summary**

Relative delta power values (i.e. proportion of total spectral power in the delta band) were extracted from the `B_CH` output in Luna for channel **EEG_F8_F7**, focusing on the **DELTA** band and subject **MS32**. Data were stratified by visit (V1: pre-treatment, V2: post-treatment), and visualized using a **boxplot overlaid with jittered points**, each representing a single night. This enables assessment of central tendency and night-to-night variability across visits.

```{r}
ms32_df <- dreem_initial$PSD$B_CH %>%
  rename(standard_id = ID) %>%
  left_join(metadata, by = "standard_id") %>%
  filter(subject_id == "MS32", CH == "EEG_F8_F7", B == "DELTA")

ggplot(ms32_df, aes(x = visit, y = RELPSD)) +
  geom_boxplot(fill = "lightpink", color = "black", outlier.shape = NA) +
  geom_jitter(width = 0.1, alpha = 0.6, color = "black") +
  labs(
    title = "MS32: Relative Delta Power by Visit (EEG_F8_F7)",
    subtitle = "Comparing pre- and post-treatment delta band power across nights",
    x = "Visit", y = "Relative Delta Power"
  ) +
  theme_bw(base_size = 14) +
  theme(
    plot.title = element_text(face = "bold", size = 16),
    plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 12),
    axis.title = element_text(face = "bold"),
    axis.text = element_text(size = 12)
  )
```

![](images/clipboard-3581646428.png)

#### **Interpretation of Results & Preliminary Conclusion**

The plot suggests a **modest increase in relative delta power** from Visit 1 to Visit 2. While variability remains across nights in both conditions, the **median delta power is higher in V2**, potentially indicating **improved sleep depth following treatment**. This pattern aligns with the hypothesis that **effective eczema management may enhance sleep physiology**, possibly by reducing sleep fragmentation or discomfort.

These preliminary findings highlight the **value of within-subject comparisons across visits**, and suggest that **delta power may serve as a sensitive neurophysiological marker of treatment response** in pediatric AE populations. Further statistical testing and replication across subjects is required to support generalization.

### Post-Hoc Comparisons of Relative Delta Power Across AE Severity Groups

#### **Purpose & Rationale**

The goal of this analysis was to explore between-group differences in **relative delta band power** (from channel EEG_F8_F7) among three groups: **healthy controls**, **mild AE**, and **severe AE**. Since an initial ANOVA indicated a statistically significant group effect, post-hoc comparisons using **Tukey's Honest Significant Difference (HSD)** test were employed to identify which specific group differences were driving the effect.

```{r}
delta_df <- rel_df %>% filter(B == "DELTA")
model <- aov(RELPSD ~ group, data = delta_df)
summary(model)
TukeyHSD(model)

```

```{r}
# Run model
delta_df <- rel_df %>% filter(B == "DELTA")
model <- aov(RELPSD ~ group, data = delta_df)

# Extract Tukey HSD results and clean up
tukey_df <- TukeyHSD(model)$group %>%
  as.data.frame() %>%
  rownames_to_column("Comparison") %>%
  rename(
    Difference = diff,
    Lower_CI = lwr,
    Upper_CI = upr,
    p_value = `p adj`
  ) %>%
  mutate(Significant = ifelse(p_value < 0.05, "Yes", "No"))

# Format into a nice table
tukey_df %>%
  gt() %>%
  tab_header(
    title = "Tukey HSD Post-Hoc Test: Relative Delta Power by Group"
  ) %>%
  fmt_number(columns = c(Difference, Lower_CI, Upper_CI, p_value), decimals = 4) %>%
  data_color(
    columns = Significant,
    colors = scales::col_factor(
      palette = c("white", "lightpink"),
      domain = c("No", "Yes")
    )
  ) %>%
  tab_style(
    style = list(cell_text(weight = "bold")),
    locations = cells_body(
      rows = Significant == "Yes"
    )
  )

```

#### **Statistical Summary**

-   **ANOVA Result**:
    `F(2, 1542) = 7.579`, **p = 0.00053** → Significant group effect in relative delta power.

-   **Tukey HSD Post-Hoc**:![](images/Screenshot 2025-07-25 at 21.22.22.png)

### **Interpretation & Notes**

-   **mild AE vs. healthy controls**: This was the only **significant** comparison. The delta power was **lower** in mild AE participants compared to healthy controls, suggesting an atypical suppression of slow-wave activity in this subgroup, potentially indicative of early or distinct neurophysiological alterations.

-   **severe AE vs. healthy controls**: Despite a similar direction of difference, this was **not significant**. The wider confidence interval crossing zero suggests more **within-group variability** and/or **smaller effect size**. It may reflect that severe AE participants show more heterogeneous EEG patterns or compensatory mechanisms influencing delta power.

-   **severe AE vs. mild AE**: Also **non-significant**. The small effect size and wide CI indicate overlapping distributions, and any group difference is likely subtle or masked by individual variability.
